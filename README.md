# Mother 2 English Translation for the Gameboy Advance
This is a work-in-progress Engish translation patch for Mother 2 on the Gameboy Advance that utilizes the Maternal Bound Redux script and jeffman's variable-width-font codebase. This project builds off of the ground work from the Mother 1 + 2 Fan Translation(in progress) but omits elements related to Earthbound.
