# Mother 2 Advance
This is a work-in-progress Engish translation patch for Mother 2 on the Gameboy Advance that utilizes the Maternal Bound Redux script and jeffman's variable-width-font(VFW) codebase. This project builds off of the ground work from the Mother 1 + 2 Fan Translation(in progress) but omits most elements related to Earthbound.

## WHY
As a long time fan of the Mother series, the thought of being able to play the entire series on the Gameboy Advance was very appealing to me, with it being my favorite handheld console of all time. When I discovered the project to translate Mother 2 on the GBA with VFW, I was very excited to learn more. My excitedment dulled slightly however, when I discovered that the fan translation's goal was to translate Mother 2 into Earthbound. Very much inspired by the work done to translate Mother 1 and Mother 3 on the GBA, I decided to take matters in to my own hand to create a portable Mother 2 experience that I would want to play. Utilizing the script from the excellent Maternal Bound Redux project in tandem with the groundwork laid down by the Mother 2 translation team, I look forward to completing Mother 2 Advance.
