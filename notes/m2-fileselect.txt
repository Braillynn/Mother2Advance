80035AC: print file select/naming string
    r0: tile x
    r1: tile y
    r2: characters to print
    r3: string buffer (0xFF terminated)
    sp: arg4

g = arg4 * 20
row = 0 or 1 (note that it scans each string twice, once for the first row of tiles and once for the second row)
tileset destination = [82B79B4 + g] + (x * 2) + ((y + row) * [82B79BC + g] * 2)

----

A template tileset is decompressed from 86DB070 to 200A400 (note: "1: Ness" starts printing to 200A434)
It seems to get fully overwritten, so we can replace it with all blank tiles

----

We also need to blank out the font that gets decompressed from 86D9808 to VRAM at 6008000

----

Note that the palette on these screens uses 0x1 for background, 0x9 for foreground

----

We need to allocate more space for the strings... The same only allocates 32 bytes per file slot,
but we need at least 41:

    "X: "                   3
    "NAME "                 5
    [FE 5F xx]              3
    "Level: XX"             9
    [FE 5F xx]              3
    "Text speed: Medium"    18
                          = 41
